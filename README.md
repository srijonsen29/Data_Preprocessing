# Data_Preprocessing
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on data preprocessing, a crucial step in machine learning to clean, transform, and structure data for analysis. The provided Jupyter Notebook (DataPreProcessing.ipynb) includes essential preprocessing techniques to ensure high-quality data for model training.


ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

DataPreProcessing.ipynb â€“ Contains the step-by-step implementation of data preprocessing techniques.


âš¡ Features & Techniques Used

âœ… Handling Missing Values (Imputation, Dropping)

âœ… Data Encoding (Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding)

âœ… Feature Scaling (Normalization, Standardization)

âœ… Handling Outliers

âœ… Feature Selection

âœ… Data Splitting (Train-Test Split)


ðŸ”§ How to Use

Install Dependencies (if not already installed)

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn


Open Jupyter Notebook

jupyter notebook DataPreProcessing.ipynb


Run the Notebook step by step to understand and apply preprocessing techniques.


ðŸ“Š Expected Outcome

Cleaned and transformed dataset ready for machine learning models.

Insights into data distribution, handling missing values, and feature selection.
